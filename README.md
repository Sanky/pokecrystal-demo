# pokecrystal-demo

This is a hand-crafted ROM hack based on [Pokémon Crystal](https://github.com/kanzure/pokecrystal). You can read the original announcement [here](https://github.com/kanzure/pokecrystal-demo/wiki/Announcement).


## Base ROM

The following ROM is required for compiling:

```
Pokemon - Crystal Version (UE) (V1.0) [C][!].gbc
md5: 9f2922b235a5eeb78d65594e82ef5dde
```

Eventually this will not be necessary.
